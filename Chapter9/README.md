# x86 Assembly Code: Strings and Arrays

This directory contains examples of working with strings and arrays in x86 assembly language. The code demonstrates how to manipulate and print strings, access and manipulate arrays, and perform basic I/O operations using the Irvine32 library.

## Project Overview

The primary focus of this project is to showcase basic string and array operations in assembly language for the x86 architecture. The code utilizes the Irvine32 library, which provides easy-to-use functions for input/output operations.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **String Operations**: Storing, printing, and manipulating null-terminated strings.
- **Array Handling**: Accessing array elements, printing values from arrays, and working with indexed loops.
- **Basic I/O**: Using the Irvine32 library functions like `WriteString`, `WriteDec`, and `Crlf` for console output.

## Files in this Directory
- **strings_and_arrays.asm**: The main assembly code that demonstrates string and array handling in x86 assembly.
- **Irvine32.inc**: The Irvine32 library header file needed to compile the program.
- **README.md**: This file.
